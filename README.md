## SpringBoot-API - Part 1 Summary
This repository contains the implementation of a Spring Boot REST API for organizing and managing module timetables. The API allows tracking of convenors, modules, and sessions delivered in each module.

# Summary
In Part 1 of the project, the following tasks were completed:

Design and Documentation: The API endpoints were designed and documented using OpenAPI 3 (OAS3) specification. Swagger Editor was used to create the API specification in YAML format.

Implementation: The provided starter project (part1.zip) was used as the starting point. The Spring Boot framework was used to implement the API endpoints. The endpoints were organized into three REST controllers: ConvenorRestController, ModuleRestController, and SessionRestController.

Testing: Postman was used to create test requests for each endpoint. Two test requests were created for each endpoint: one for successful responses and one for error responses. A Postman Collection was created to run all the tests in sequence.

Technical Skills Utilized
The following technical skills were employed in Part 1 of the project:

**Spring Boot**: Used to create a RESTful API with Java.

**OpenAPI**: Utilized OpenAPI 3 (OAS3) specification to design and document the API endpoints.

**Swagger Editor**: Used for designing and documenting the API specification in YAML format.

**Postman**: Employed to create and execute test requests for each endpoint.

Please refer to the detailed instructions provided in the initial question for more information on the tasks and requirements of Part 1.

For more details and implementation code, please refer to the project files in the repository.

Note: The implementation files and the Postman Collection have not been included in this summary README. Please refer to the actual repository for the complete code and resources.
